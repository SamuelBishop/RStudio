How to use the R programming language:

Day 2:

Tidyverse:
- Introduces the pipe operator %>%
	. Don't have to call functions on the data sets in reverse order.
	. Can start with the first one and have them done later. (See example)
	
Long vs. Wide Data:
- WIDE (compact, good for visualization)
- LONG (each instance of data, not a table)
	. This one is usually better for R functions

Joining Multiple Data Sets:
- Left (Join matching vals from y to x)
- Right (Join matching vals from x to y)
- Inner (Join data. Retain only full rows with matches)
- Full (Join data. Retain all values, all rows)

BEFORE YOU START CODING: You can get help for any function
	on the help page. Use the search tab.


ACTUAL R CODING:
- ctrl + enter = make console run this line of code

	SYNTAX
	- [] => indexing matrix/data
	- $ => accessing the value of a matrix
	example:
		summary(cars$dist[cars$speed>=15])
		... gives values of dataset of cars that are greater than or equal to
		15 and performs certain transformations on them (min, max, etc).
	- subset => keeps the values that meet requirements as a set of data
	example:
		summary(subset(cars,speed >= 15, dist))
	- %>% => piping. Allows you to sequentially see the transformations applied to
		dataset.
	example:
		cars %>%                                # using pipe operator
		  filter(speed >= 15) %>% 
		  select(dist) %>% 
		  summary()
	- <- => Storage operator. Saves something as a variable name.
	
	FUNCTIONS THAT CAN BE PERFORMED ON DATA:
	- .frame => Not sure what it does *******
	example:
		df_wide <- data.frame(row = LETTERS[1:3], a = 1:3, b = 4:6, c = 7:9)
	- pivot_longer => makes a datafame long data format.
	- pivot_wider => make a datafram wide data format.
	Important ones:
	- filter => ****
	- select => ****
	- mutate => ****
	- unite => everytime it sees two different things it will combine them into one
	- separate => everytime it sees something it will break it up into multiple data sets
	
	
	SETTING WORKING DIRECTORY AND IMPORTING DATASETS:
	- getwd() => getting the working directory
	- setwd("C:/Users/Sam Bishop/Desktop/git/RStudio/example code") => setting the working directory
	- reading a csv (from the ReadR package)
	example:
		purchase <- read_csv("approved_data_purchase-v5.csv",na = c("", "NA","NULL")) # NULL is not a default NA character string
		zipcodes <- read_csv("zipcodes.csv")
	
	
- Dataframe: A matrix that can have a mix of variable types within it.
